                <p>
                    <strong>Terry Fox</strong> was a Canadian athlete and cancer research activist who became a national hero for his incredible determination and spirit. <br/> 
                    After losing his leg to cancer at the age of 18, Terry embarked on the ambitious journey known as the Marathon of Hope in 1980, aiming to run across Canada to raise awareness and funds for cancer research. <br/> 
                    His relentless pursuit inspired millions, as he ran an average of 42 kilometers a day for 143 days, covering over 5,300 kilometers before his illness forced him to stop. <br/> 
                    <em>Terry's legacy lives on</em> through the annual Terry Fox Run, which continues to raise funds for cancer research and inspire new generations to fight against cancer. <br/> 
                    His unwavering courage and commitment to making a difference remind us all of the power of hope and perseverance.

                <p>
                    The Chinese railway system is one of the most extensive and advanced in the world, playing a crucial role in the country's economic development and connectivity. <br/> 
                    Since the early 2000s, China has invested heavily in high-speed rail, transforming travel across vast distances. <br/> 
                    The network now includes over 40,000 kilometers of high-speed rail lines, enabling trains to reach speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour. <br/> 
                    This modernization not only enhances passenger travel but also boosts freight efficiency, supporting industries and commerce nationwide. <br/> 
                    The Chinese railway symbolizes the countryâ€™s rapid growth and commitment to infrastructure, connecting cities and regions like never before.

                <p>
                    Residential schools in Canada were government-sponsored institutions established to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. <br/> 
                    Operating from the late 19th century until the 1990s, these schools aimed to erase Indigenous identities by removing children from their families and communities. <br/> 
                    Many children faced harsh conditions, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, resulting in long-lasting trauma for survivors and their families. <br/> 
                    The legacy of residential schools has had profound impacts on Indigenous communities, contributing to intergenerational trauma and cultural disconnection. <br/> 
                    <strong>Acknowledging this dark chapter</strong> in Canadian history is essential for reconciliation and healing, as efforts continue to honor the experiences of survivors and restore Indigenous cultures.
